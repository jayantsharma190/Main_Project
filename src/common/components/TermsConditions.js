            Pinpointstay is an online portal and acts only as a facilitator
            between individual and landlord/owner and does not act as an agent
            of any of the party (User/individual/tenant and Landlord/owner). The
            transaction between the User and the Company is direct.
            <br />

            information / expiry date / CVV / OTP details to any person; the
